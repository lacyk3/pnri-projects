The ability to automatically quantify phenotypic traits of microbial communities from images in an accurate and robust manner is crucial to advancing high-throughput genetic studies. Using tools from the python scientific stack, we have developed a flexible, open source pipeline to automate the extraction of meaningful quantitative features characterizing colony sizes and textures from plate images.

* **Funnel Cross Project**: This repository contains the python scripts used to process phenotype images for <`cite paper and include link`>. 
  - `RenameImages.ipynb` was used to rename phenotype images by reading the bar code present in each image and matching it to a human-readable plate name saved in a csv master list.
  - `ExtractValues.ipynb` was used to automatically crop images to the region of interest, segment patches from the background, and extract growth data: the area in pixels and the sum of the intensities of all pixels within the colony.
