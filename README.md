The ability to automatically quantify phenotypic traits of microbial communities from images in an accurate and robust manner is crucial to advancing high-throughput genetic studies. Using tools from the python scientific stack, we have developed a flexible, open source pipeline to automate the extraction of meaningful quantitative features characterizing colony sizes and textures from plate images.
