Projects for Dudley lab at Pacific Northwest Research Institute

The ability to automatically quantify phenotypic traits of microbial communities from images in an accurate and robust manner is crucial to advancing high-throughput genetic studies. Using tools from the python scientific stack, we have developed a flexible, open source pipeline to automate the extraction of meaningful quantitative features characterizing colony sizes and textures from plate images.
